PhotoView
=========
Windows Photo Viewer (PRE-ALPHA)<br><br>

This application is intended to be a minimalistic image viewer with a focus on speed.<br><br>
It is currently in early development, and can be used to open images both by drag and drop or as a default image application.<br>
I am currently working on implementing directory browsing functionality.
